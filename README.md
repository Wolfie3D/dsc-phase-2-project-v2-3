#### The task at hand involved analysis of the King County Housing data and extracting meaningfull insights that may impact on the prices of houses. Thereafter we built a model using various models specifically linear models. 

#### Everyone of us had his/her task. The most intuitive part involves extracting new features from the dat and using the features to develop a predictive model for the house prices. The measure of score we used was the r2 score as well as the normalized RMSE scores. RMSE scores always vary according to the range of the dependent variable. 

#### Before any modelling process, data cleaning is very paramount as one may end up extracting wrong insights. One should also focus on following the best practices when developing models and a clear explanation should be given on why a specific model is chose. Runtime and accuracy are of acute importance in the modelling process.
